                    Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. 
                    The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. 
                    Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map.
                    Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles of play.
                    During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.
                    A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.

                 <p class="text-white wow animate__bounceInRight mb-4">
                     Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.
                     Based on the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales,it is inspired by both the character's decade-long comic book mythology and the 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,which helped popularize him.
                     The game is a spin-off/continuation of Marvel's Spider-Man, and depicts Miles' struggle to balance the duties of his civilian persona and his role as the second Spider-Man when his new home, Harlem, is threatened by a war between the Roxxon Energy Corporation and the Tinkerer's high-tech criminal army,the Underground.

                     <br>
                     Gameplay is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Miles' traversal and combat abilities. Miles can freely move around New York City, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and unlocking new gadgets and suits by progressing through the main story or completing tasks. Outside the story, the player is able to complete side missions to unlock additional content and collectible items. 
                     Combat focuses on chaining attacks together and using the environment and webs to incapacitate numerous foes while avoiding damage.

                        The Witcher is a 2007 action role-playing game developed by CD Projekt Red for Microsoft Windows and CD Projekt on OS X. 
                        It was based on the fantasy novel series The Witcher by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The game's story takes place after the events of the main saga.
                        It was released in 2007 to positive reviews from critics and received an aggregate score of 81/100 on Metacritic. In 2009, a console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, was scheduled for release using an entirely new engine and combat system. This was suspended as a result of payment problems with console developers Widescreen Games. 
                        The first game has, to date, two sequels, namely The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015.
