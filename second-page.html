                    The game takes place in a realistic and modern setting.
                    The campaign follows a CIA officer and British SAS forces as they team up with rebels from the fictional country of Urzikstan, combating together against Russian forces who have invaded the country and the terrorist group Al-Qatala.

                    A post-launch update introduces a free-to-play battle royale mode, Warzone, which was also marketed as a standalone title.
